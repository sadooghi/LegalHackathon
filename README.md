# Project Description
Paradvo is an application which connects lawyers with clients.

Think about a time when you want to buy a condo and need to find a lawyer to check the condo's status certificate. You need to search for a lawyer online, find many lawyers and law firms, call them one by one, ask for a quote, write them down and at the end, choose one based on their quote. This is frustrating!
On the other side, there are many junior solo practitioner lawyers or new grads who have a hard time bringing a new client on themselves.

Paradvo will help both groups by connecting them together. By using Paradvo, solo lawyers have the opportunity to find new clients and people who are looking for a lawyer, can easily find one which matches their criteria.
